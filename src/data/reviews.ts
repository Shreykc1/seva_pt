      text: "ADPT by SEVA is a facility that helps to build not only the strength and recovery needed to physically heal but also encourages the positive mental attitude it takes to push through the pain to fully rehabilitate. The therapists are engaged and work hard to map out a plan specifically for the individual's needs. Excellent!",

      text: "Being a professional dancer I've met a lot of physical therapists and Laurence is by far the most skilled, patient and understanding. Not only did she help me target areas to strengthen but she also adapted each exercise so that I could relate it to dance. I felt supported and prepared physically even in the midst of a pandemic with a tailored approach which has been a privilege to experience.",

      text: "I first came in 3 months post ACL reconstruction last year and I've been coming to ADPT for 10 months now. Within 10 months, I went from struggling to walk without crutches to jogging and doing plyometrics training now! Alvin, my PT, truly cares about my goals and has been very transparent about the different stages of recovery and milestones that I have to achieve before returning to sports. This really helps me focus on small goals and celebrate the progress that I've made along the way. The whole team treats me like a professional athlete and they have pushed me to train harder than I ever had. They've helped me become stronger than I was before my injury.",

      text: "Dipti is an awesome physical therapist. She is kind, sensitive, and holistically insightful, sharing her thoughts and information with you in a way that's encouraging and empowering. She has helped me solve my long-lasting issues with neck/shoulder tension and alignment, which is a great relief and very motivating - I'm now working on strength training! It's been a pleasure to work with her at Cynergy Cobble Hill, I highly recommend Mena and this physical therapy practice",
